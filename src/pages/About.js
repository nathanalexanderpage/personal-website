        It's me here. Who? Me! My name's up top, dummy! Don't pretend you ever stopped wanting me on your dev team. I'm an up-and-coming, disruptive add to your team who's about to rock the sox off the executive branch from way down undah. What's that? You'd like to send me abroad? Well, that's just a little of my subliminal messaging talent at work. Not convinced? Try my services out free for one year for a small fee of a year's salary!
