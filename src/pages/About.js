        In case you came directly to this page: My name is Nathan. Hello.

      <p>
        I'm a full-stack web developer whose passions within programming lie in modularity and scalability, among other things. I recently emerged victorious from a three-month Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp experience at General Assembly in Seattle, and am ready to take my experience and know-how from this into industry to produce something worthy of pride. My energy in the workplace comes from feeling that what I deliver will have a positive impact on my team and more largely the end users. See the areas in which I have skills listed below.
